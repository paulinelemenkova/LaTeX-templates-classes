\begin{abstract}
This is a theme for the \LaTeX{} \texttt{beamer} class for presentations. It
has been designed to  match the official UA templates for Microsoft
PowerPoint\textsuperscript{\textregistered} while doing away with some of the
shortcomings of it within the \texttt{beamer} framework. If you would like to
give a scientific presentation with all the benefits you get from using
\LaTeX{}, this theme is for you.\footnote{Note that there exists another
\texttt{beamer} theme for the Universiteit Antwerpen designed by \textsc{Kris
Ven} \cite{Ven::BTU}, which has many more options than this package. In
contrast to this theme, it is not designed with compliance to the official
themes in mind.}

% Moreover, as of this writing, it is not known to the author whether or not that theme is still being made available for download.
